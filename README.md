## Basic story for the creation of this repo:

I was incredibly tired of having problems with c/c++ libraries...
Therefore, I decided to make a basic way to initialize a simple CMAKE project 
with the files needed to implement VCPKG library tools.

## How to get started:

All instructions for the use of this repo can be found in the "instructions.md" file in the "tutorial" folder :D


## Things to know before using:

### Dependencies (all covered in the tutorial):
- Install CMAKE (using your preferred package manager)
- Install VCPKG (if you don't have it already, go to their github repo and follow their instructions. It shouldn't be hard)
- Install g++ (also using your preferred package manager)

### What should I know before getting started?

It is recommended to know the basic file structure for CMAKE projects since this repo only provides a fast start for your code.
After that, you should add libraries, include files and manage other things as you see fit (which requires knowlege of CMAKE...).

## Extra Stuff:

This crude repo is basically just for me, but should anyone need anything else related to it, feel free to add it. 
And don't miss out on the easy tutorial :)
